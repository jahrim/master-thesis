\section{Convergence Simulation}
\label{section:design:convergence-simulation}

The simulation interface can be extended once more to provide direct support
for aggregate convergence tests, exposing an operation for evaluating the limit
of an aggregate evolution with respect to time, that is a stable state for
self-stabilising specifications. To support such operation, during the
configuration phase, a simulation should accept a \textbf{halt policy}, which
is a condition that stops the simulation when satisfied. Moreover, such halt
policy should be designed so that the simulation is stopped when the aggregate
reaches a stable state.

For example, for a step simulation, a suitable halt policy would be to stop the
simulation when there are no more exports that can be extracted from the device
queues. Instead, for a general reactive simulation, a suitable halt policy
would be to stop the simulation after a certain period of inactivity (i.e.,
time elapsed since the last emitted event). However, real-world time introduces
non-determinism in the results of the simulations, rendering the policy not
suitable for testing.
