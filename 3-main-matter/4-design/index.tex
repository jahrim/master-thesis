\chapter{Design}
\label{chapter:design}

This chapter presents the abstract solution designed for achieving the
objectives of this project. First, Section \ref{section:design:simulation}
introduces an extension of the base reactive execution model of FRASP with
increased observability and controllability. Then, Section
\ref{section:design:step-simulation} provides a solution to the halting problem
of FRASP simulations. Afterwards, Section
\ref{section:design:convergence-simulation} explains the process of performing
aggregate convergence tests leveraging the new simulation models. Finally,
Section \ref{section:design:concurrent-simulation} describes the parallelism
constraints on concurrent simulations.
