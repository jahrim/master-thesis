\subsection{Functional Reactive Programming}
\label{section:background:concepts:frp}

\textbf{\ac{FRP}} is a subset of both \textit{reactive programming} and
\textit{functional programming}, retaining the advantages of the former,
while promoting \textbf{compositionality}, which is a property of semantics,
holding if the meaning of an expression is solely determined by the meaning of
its parts and the rules used to combine them \cite{FRP}.

In functional programming, compositionality is achieved by expressing software
behaviors as \textbf{pure functions}, that is functions in the mathematical
sense of the term. Pure functions produce \textit{no observable side effects}
when applied and are \textbf{referentially transparent}, meaning that different
applications of a function to the same input always produce the same outputs.
To attain referential transparence, functions should avoid referencing
\textit{shared mutable data}, so that their behavior is kept constant since
their definition and cannot have side effects.

In reactive programming, compositionality also requires glitch freedom, as
observable glitches may invalidate the behavior expressed by a function.
Indeed, functions may express different behaviors due to inconsistent handling
of simultaneous events by the underlying evaluation model.

Compositionality is essential for dealing with complex software, tackling its
complexity by combining simpler components that are easier to reason about.
Moreover, it deals with scalable software, tackling their growing complexity
over time by facilitating the addition of new features to existing composable
applications.
