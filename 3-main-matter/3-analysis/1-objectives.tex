\section{Objectives}
\label{section:analysis:objectives}

As anticipated in Section \ref{section:introduction:content} of the
introduction, FRASP is currently in research and requires a consolidated test
suite supporting the research process, setting expectations on the behavior of
the framework and assessing the correctness of its current state, so that
software regressions may be avoided during its development. Additionally, the
test suite could discover unexpected implications of the reactive model adopted
by FRASP, as there are no guarantees on the equivalence between a reactive or
round-based execution of the same specification.

At the current state, the test suite of the FRASP language contains only a few
tests and samples verifying the reactivity and the generation of the device
exports for each language construct individually (\textbf{semantic tests}),
while functional tests concerning the execution of aggregate specifications
(\textbf{aggregate tests}) are missing. In other words, there are no tests
verifying that an aggregate evolves following the user's specification.

The goal of this project is to implement the missing aggregate tests, assessing
the correctness of several specifications, executed against different network
configurations and environments. \ac{ScaFi} will be used as a reference for
establishing the expectations on FRASP specifications, so that FRASP may be
empirically proved functionally equivalent to \ac{ScaFi}, while retaining its
reactive benefits.
