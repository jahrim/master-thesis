\chapter{Analysis}
\label{chapter:analysis}

This chapter performs an analysis of the objectives and requirements of this
project, outlining the strategy to achieve them. First, Section
\ref{section:analysis:objectives} introduces the objective of the project,
which is the implementation of functional tests for FRASP. Then, Section
\ref{section:analysis:aggregate-testing} explains the process of testing
aggregate specifications, while Section
\ref{section:analysis:aggregate-convergence-testing} describes the specific
strategy adopted for testing aggregate specifications, mostly based on
convergence properties. Finally, Section \ref{section:analysis:simulation}
concerns the verification of properties through simulations and analyzes the
attributes of an ideal simulator.
